# Hendrix Cat Collector

### screenshots

This app is intended for Hendrix students to keep track of the cats they see on campus.

It allows them to add locations and cats while they're out on a cat hunt!

This project helped me learn the basics of Flutter and Dart, and now I can start making more complicated apps in the future.
